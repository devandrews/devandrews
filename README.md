### Hello I'm Andrews Patrick - aka devandrews

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently improving my MERN stack, Typescript, GraphQL, React Native, and some other skills. Im trying to reach Advanced/Fluency in English as well.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m learning Clean Archicterure, S.O.L.I.D and soft skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not developing for job, I'm learning for myself, because programming is like a hobbie to me too. It's great when you can work with what you like.
